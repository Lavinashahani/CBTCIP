# CBTCIP
This is my github repository for my internship tasks at CipherByte Technologies as a C++ intern.
Task 1 is a digital calculator which is made in C++ language using functions, loops, C++ libraries and basic cout and cin commands. The IDE used to make this project is Code::Blocks.
Task 2 is a student record management system which is made by using C++ concepts like classes, objets, file handling, loops and basic commands that are used in every program. the IDE used for this project is Code::Blocks. Also this system stores the data of the student permanently and do not disappears on the exit of compiler.
